Asynchronous Backing is a major evolution in the Polkadot parachain protocol, introducing pipelining to dramatically increase parachain throughput and network efficiency. This technical innovation is a core component of Polkadot 2.0, enabling greater scalability and optimized resource utilization.

## Historical Context

Before Asynchronous Backing, Polkadot used a “Synchronous Backing” model, where the production of parachain blocks (parablocks) was tightly coupled to relay chain progression. This model limited parachain block production to every 12 seconds, with just 0.5 seconds of execution time—creating significant bottlenecks in performance.

## What is Asynchronous Backing?

Asynchronous Backing applies pipelining to the process of parachain block generation, backing, and inclusion. This technique divides tasks into smaller stages, allowing multiple stages to run concurrently and enabling the next step to start before the previous one finishes.

In Polkadot, Asynchronous Backing allows:

- Parablocks to be included every 6 seconds (instead of 12)
- Execution time to increase to 2 seconds (up from 0.5 seconds)
- Multiple unbacked parablocks to be processed simultaneously
- Building new parablocks on ancestors that have not yet been included in the relay chain

## How Asynchronous Backing Works

It introduces two key concepts:

- **Unincluded Segments**: Chains of candidate parablocks not yet included in the relay chain. Collators can build new blocks on these ancestors, creating a queue of blocks pending inclusion.
- **Prospective Parachains**: A tracking system on the relay chain for submitted but unbacked parablocks, including all unbacked ancestry.

### Process Overview:

1. Collators generate new parablocks from unincluded segments without waiting for previous inclusion.
2. Backing and inclusion occur in parallel across different blocks.
3. Parablocks are included every 6 seconds.
4. Collators have 2 seconds of execution time—4x more than before.

## Configurable Parameters

Asynchronous Backing is governed by two key parameters (modifiable via governance):

- **max_candidate_depth**: Max number of unbacked parachain blocks a collator can produce. Default is 3, allowing 4 unbacked blocks.
- **allowed_ancestry_len**: Determines how far back a relay parent can be used to build a parachain block. Default is 2 (third-to-last relay parent).

Relay chain and parachain configurations must align. For example, the relay chain must set `scheduling_lookahead` to 2 to avoid degraded parachain block times.

## Benefits of Asynchronous Backing

- **Higher Throughput**: Parablocks included every 6 seconds instead of 12.
- **Extended Execution Time**: Increases from 0.5 to 2 seconds, allowing more data processing.
- **Efficient Pipelining**: Backing and inclusion occur in parallel.
- **Block Reuse**: Unincluded blocks can be reproposed, reducing wasted blockspace.
- **Massive Efficiency Boost**: Expected to deliver 8x more blockspace to parachains (2x inclusion + 4x execution time).

## Implementation for Parachains

To adopt Asynchronous Backing, parachains must make several changes:

- **Phase 1**: Upgrade to the latest Cumulus version and configure `pallet_parachain_system` to use `FixedVelocityConsensusHook`.
- **Phase 2**: Implement the **Lookahead Collator** to build on unincluded segments.
- **Phase 3**: Enable Asynchronous Backing with:
  - `AllowMultipleBlocksPerSlot = true`
  - Increase `UNINCLUDED_SEGMENT_CAPACITY`
  - Set `MILLISECS_PER_BLOCK = 6000`
  - Update related parameters

Parachains measuring time by their own block number may need to reference the relay chain block number instead (`LastRelayChainBlockNumber` in `pallet-parachain-system`) to avoid timing issues.

## Asynchronous Backing and Elastic Scaling

Asynchronous Backing lays the foundation for **Elastic Scaling**, another key Polkadot 2.0 innovation. Once Elastic Scaling is live, parachains will be able to produce multiple blocks per relay chain block, scaling dynamically based on need.

This parachain-side flexibility will be complemented by relay chain-side innovations like agile core usage and coretime allocation, allowing dynamic scaling across the entire network.

## Conclusion

Asynchronous Backing is a significant leap in the Polkadot parachain protocol. By introducing pipelining and increasing both block frequency and execution time, it promises to deliver up to 8x more blockspace to parachains—greatly enhancing scalability. As a foundational component of Polkadot 2.0, it sets the stage for future advancements like Elastic Scaling, contributing to the vision of a highly scalable and interoperable blockchain ecosystem.

## Summary

This lesson explored Asynchronous Backing as a core innovation of Polkadot 2.0. We discussed how pipelining enables parachains to produce blocks every 6 seconds (down from 12), with execution time extended to 2 seconds. We introduced the concepts of unincluded segments and prospective parachains, which allow collators to build on unfinalized ancestors. We highlighted key configuration parameters—`max_candidate_depth` and `allowed_ancestry_len`—and the significant benefits in throughput and efficiency. We also examined how parachains can implement Asynchronous Backing and how it sets the foundation for Elastic Scaling, further advancing the scalability of the Polkadot ecosystem.
