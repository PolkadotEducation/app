In Polkadot's Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) system, two key roles work together to secure the network: validators and nominators. These participants form the backbone of Polkadot's consensus mechanism, each with distinct responsibilities and requirements.

## Validators: The Network Guardians

Validators are the active participants who perform the critical operations that keep the Polkadot network secure and functioning.

### Core Responsibilities of Validators

1. **Block Production**: Participate in consensus to produce new blocks.
2. **Parachain Validation**: Validate parachain blocks to ensure data integrity.

### Technical Requirements for Validators

- Dedicated server with strong CPU, RAM, and storage
- Reliable, high-speed internet
- Technical knowledge of CLI, system management, and security
- Continuous operation and monitoring

### Economic Requirements for Validators

- Must stake their own DOT
- Need sufficient total stake (self + nominations)
- Must tolerate slashing risk for misbehavior

### Validator Selection Process

- Limited active validator slots (e.g., ~300)
- Selection happens every era (~24h) via Phragm√©n algorithm
- Based on total stake (self + nominators)
- Unselected candidates stay in the waiting pool

## Nominators: The Stake Delegators

Nominators play a critical support role by backing validators with their DOT, helping secure the network.

### Core Responsibilities of Nominators

1. **Validator Selection**: Choose reliable validators.
2. **Stake Delegation**: Bond DOT to support them.
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Re-evaluate and re-nominate when needed.

### Why Become a Nominator?

- Participate in building Web3
- Support network security
- Use bonded tokens to vote in governance
- Earn staking rewards to offset inflation

### Economic Requirements for Nominators

- Around 450 DOT minimum for direct nomination (fluctuates)
- As little as 1 DOT in nomination pools
- 28-day unbonding period when withdrawing

### Nominator Selection Strategy

- Look at commission rates
- Review performance and uptime
- Prefer validators with strong self-stake
- Diversify across up to 16 validators

## The Relationship Between Validators and Nominators

### Economic Alignment

- **Shared Rewards**: Earned when validators perform well
- **Shared Risks**: Both can be slashed for misbehavior
- **Mutual Selection**: Validators attract nominations; nominators choose wisely

### Reward Distribution

1. Validator takes commission
2. Remaining rewards are shared pro-rata by stake
3. Rewards auto-compound by default
4. Distributed at end of each era

## Slashing: The Security Mechanism

Slashing enforces honest behavior for validators and nominators.

### Slashable Offenses

- **Equivocation**: Signing two blocks at once
- **Unavailability**: Prolonged downtime
- **Invalid Validation**: Accepting invalid parachain blocks

### Impact on Validators and Nominators

- Both lose a portion of their stake
- Severity varies with offense and number of violators
- Nominators are penalized proportionally to their stake

## Practical Aspects of Participation

### Becoming a Validator

Steps include:

1. Set up and configure a node
2. Generate session keys
3. Bond DOT tokens
4. Submit intention to validate
5. Attract nominations

### Becoming a Nominator

Steps include:

1. Choose a wallet (e.g., Polkadot-JS UI, Staking Dashboard)
2. Bond DOT
3. Select up to 16 validators
4. Monitor validator performance

## Advanced Concepts

### Validator Economics

- Set commission rate strategically
- Cover infrastructure and operation costs
- Prevent slashing with good security
- Build reputation to attract nominators

### Nominator Strategies

- Rotate validators regularly
- Track performance with tools
- Diversify nominations
- Optimize for risk/reward balance

## Conclusion

Validators and nominators form the foundation of Polkadot's security model, working together to maintain the network's integrity. Validators provide technical expertise and block production; nominators provide the economic stake that secures the system.

Their symbiotic relationship, based on shared rewards and risks, ensures strong economic alignment with the health of the network. Whether acting as a validator or nominator, understanding these roles allows for informed participation in securing Polkadot.

## Summary

In this class, we explored the two key roles in Polkadot's NPoS system: validators and nominators. Validators are the active participants who produce blocks and validate parachain information, requiring significant technical resources and knowledge. Nominators support validators by staking DOT tokens, helping secure the network while earning rewards. The relationship between validators and nominators creates strong economic alignment through shared rewards and risks, particularly through the slashing mechanism that penalizes misbehavior. We examined the practical aspects of participation for both roles and discussed advanced concepts like validator economics and nominator strategies. Together, validators and nominators form the backbone of Polkadot's security model, ensuring the network's integrity and performance.
