/>

Kusama is often described as Polkadot's "canary network" – an early, unaudited, and unrefined release of Polkadot that serves as a proving ground for blockchain technology in a real-world environment. The name "canary network" draws from the historical practice of coal miners using canaries to detect toxic gases in mines – similarly, Kusama helps detect issues before they reach Polkadot's more stable environment.

## Not Just a Testnet

It's crucial to understand that Kusama is not simply a testnet. While testnets are typically centralized environments with no real economic value, Kusama:

- Has real economic value through its native KSM token
- Is fully decentralized with no central kill switch
- Is governed entirely by its token holders through on-chain governance
- Operates as an independent, standalone network

## Key Differences Between Kusama and Polkadot

### Governance Parameters

Kusama has modified governance parameters that allow for faster upgrades. The governance process on Kusama is up to four times faster than on Polkadot. This doesn't mean the blockchain itself processes transactions faster, but rather that the time between governance events such as proposing referenda, voting, and enacting approved upgrades is shorter.

### Cost and Risk Profile

The bonding requirement for running a parachain on Kusama is lower than on Polkadot, making it a more affordable development environment. This lower barrier to entry encourages experimentation and innovation.

### Risk Tolerance

Kusama embraces chaos and is designed for teams that want to move fast and take risks. Its unofficial slogan is "Expect Chaos," reflecting its role as a place for bold experimentation.

## Historical Development of Kusama

- **Launch**: Kusama started as a Proof-of-Authority network and transitioned to Proof-of-Stake on October 28, 2019.
- **Kusama's First Adventure**: On January 4, 2020, Kusama experienced a significant issue when the Polkadot mainnet runtime was accidentally uploaded to the Kusama chain, "bricking" the chain. The fix involved a complex rollback and time manipulation.
- **Parachain Auctions**: On June 15, 2021, Kusama launched its first public parachain slot auction, marking a major milestone.

## Use Cases for Kusama

### Pre-Production Environment

Many teams use Kusama as a pre-production environment, running a parachain on both Kusama and Polkadot. They deploy, iterate, and stress-test new technologies and features on Kusama before pushing them to Polkadot.

### Experimental Playground

Some teams use Kusama exclusively for experimentation, taking advantage of its "move fast and break things" ethos to test innovative ideas.

### Upgrade Path to Polkadot

For teams planning to deploy on Polkadot, Kusama provides a path for early-stage development, community building, and testing before transitioning to Polkadot.

### Runtime Upgrade Testing

Polkadot's runtime upgrades are typically deployed to Kusama first to see how they perform under real-world conditions.

## KILT: The First Migration Success Story

In October 2021, KILT Protocol became the first parachain to migrate successfully from Kusama to Polkadot. This demonstrated the power of the canary network model, allowing KILT to test its technology before transitioning to Polkadot's more stable production network.

## The Spammening: Demonstrating Scalability

In December 2023, Kusama was used for "The Spammening" – a live test of Polkadot’s scalability. It achieved a sustained rate of over 143,000 transactions per second using only a quarter of Kusama's resources. This highlighted the extreme performance capabilities of the network.

## Kusama's Unique Features

### Kappa Sigma Mu Society

Kusama has an exclusive society called Kappa Sigma Mu, which requires members to get a tattoo to join – reflecting its experimental culture.

### Kusama Gifts

Kusama Gifts make it easy to onboard new users, send KSM tokens, or participate in crowdloans.

### Code of Conduct

Kusama has a unique Code of Conduct intended to "sustain chaos," reflecting its distinct identity.

## Future of Kusama

Kusama and Polkadot will continue to operate as independent networks with their own communities and purposes. Kusama will remain the experimental ground, while Polkadot serves production-grade deployments. Both networks will be supported by the Web3 Foundation and maintain complementary roles.

## Conclusion

Kusama is a unique innovation in the blockchain space – a "wild cousin" to Polkadot that provides a real-world environment for testing and experimentation. Its independent governance, economic value, and fast-paced nature make it ideal for teams seeking to innovate quickly. Kusama and Polkadot together form a powerful ecosystem, each serving distinct but complementary roles.

## Summary

In this class, we explored Kusama, Polkadot's canary network. We learned that Kusama is not a testnet but a full, value-bearing blockchain. We reviewed key differences from Polkadot, Kusama’s historical milestones, and its role as both a pre-production and experimental platform. We also covered its unique cultural traits and outlook as a complementary network alongside Polkadot.
