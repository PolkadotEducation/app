DOT is the native token of the Polkadot network, similar to how BTC is the native token of Bitcoin or ETH is the native token of Ethereum. As the backbone of the Polkadot ecosystem, DOT serves multiple critical functions that enable the network to operate securely and efficiently.

## The Planck Unit: DOT's Smallest Denomination

Like Bitcoin has Satoshis and Ethereum has Wei, Polkadot has its smallest unit called "Planck" (named after the Planck Length, the smallest possible distance in the physical universe).

- 1 DOT equals 10¹⁰ (10 billion) Planck
- Other denominations include Microdot (10⁴ Planck), Millidot (10⁷ Planck), and Million DOT (10¹⁶ Planck)

DOT underwent a redenomination in 2020, increasing the supply by 100x. Prior to this change, 1 DOT equaled 10¹² Planck.

## The Three Core Functions of DOT

### 1. Governance of the Network

DOT tokens give holders the power to participate in Polkadot's on-chain governance system, known as Polkadot OpenGov. This system enables multiple referenda to run simultaneously for faster decision-making.

With DOT, holders can:

- Propose protocol changes
- Vote on referenda
- Delegate voting power to others

This democratic model gives all DOT holders a voice in the evolution of the network.

### 2. Staking for Network Security

DOT plays a vital role in Polkadot's Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) consensus. By staking DOT, users help secure the network and validate transactions.

- **Validators** maintain the network, validate blocks, and earn rewards. If they act maliciously, their staked DOT can be slashed.
- **Nominators** delegate their DOT to trusted validators and share in the rewards.

This mechanism incentivizes good behavior and ensures the network remains secure and decentralized.

### 3. Bonding for Parachains

DOT is also used to bond chains to the Polkadot network as parachains. Projects must bond DOT tokens to lease a parachain slot, typically for up to two years.

Crowdloans allow DOT holders to support projects by temporarily bonding their DOT, which is returned after the lease ends. Polkadot is evolving toward a system called "coretime," which will allow for more flexible resource allocation than the current slot auction model.

## Additional Uses of DOT

### Transaction Fees

Polkadot requires transaction fees paid in DOT. These fees deter spam and compensate validators.

### Ecosystem Applications

DOT can be used across many applications in the Polkadot ecosystem. While some require specific parachain tokens, many accept DOT. Efforts are underway to increase seamless DOT integration across the ecosystem.

### Treasury Funding

A portion of DOT is allocated to the Polkadot Treasury, which funds initiatives that benefit the network. Token holders vote on these proposals via the governance system.

## DOT's Value Proposition

DOT is more than a digital currency—it is a gateway to one of the most advanced blockchain ecosystems.

By holding DOT, users gain:

- Governance rights through OpenGov
- Rewards through staking
- Access to interoperable Web3 applications
- Participation in parachain support through crowdloans

## Conclusion

The DOT token powers Polkadot by enabling governance, securing the network through staking, and connecting parachains through bonding. Its diverse functions make it one of the most versatile and essential tokens in the Web3 space. As Polkadot continues to evolve, DOT may also be used for purchasing coretime, reinforcing its utility and importance in network development.

## Summary

In this class, we explored the DOT token, the native cryptocurrency of the Polkadot network. DOT serves three primary functions: enabling governance through Polkadot OpenGov, securing the network through staking in the NPoS consensus mechanism, and bonding to connect parachains to the Polkadot ecosystem. Beyond these core functions, DOT is used for transaction fees, ecosystem applications, and treasury funding. As a multi-purpose token, DOT gives holders a stake in the future of one of the most advanced blockchain ecosystems, allowing them to participate in governance, earn rewards, and support innovative projects.
