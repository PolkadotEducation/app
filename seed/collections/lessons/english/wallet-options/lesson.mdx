## Cold Storage Wallets

For maximum security, especially for long-term holders or those with significant amounts of DOT, cold storage wallets are recommended.

### Polkadot Vault

Polkadot Vault (formerly Parity Signer) transforms an old smartphone into a cold storage wallet:

- Install the app on a factory-reset phone

- Sign transactions by scanning QR codes

### Ledger Hardware Wallets

Ledger devices offer secure hardware wallet solutions for Polkadot:

- Store private keys on a secure chip
- Require physical confirmation for transactions
- Can be used with Ledger Live or connected to many supported wallets
- Compatible with the Staking Dashboard

## Wallets for Developers and Power Users

For users who need advanced functionality and don't mind a steeper learning curve, several options are available.

### Polkadot Browser Extension

The Polkadot extension is an account manager that works with Chromium-based browsers and Firefox:

- Manages your keys and allows you to sign transactions
- Needs to interact with a UI to show account information and make transactions
- Compatible with most Web3 apps in the Polkadot ecosystem
- Recommended for storing accounts rather than using Polkadot-JS UI directly

### Polkadot-JS UI

The Polkadot-JS UI web wallet contains advanced features designed for developers and power users:

- Multi-signature accounts
- Switching signature schemes
- Full access to all Substrate chain functionality
- Comprehensive but complex interface

### Subkey

Subkey is a command-line utility for advanced users:

- Generate and manage keys
- Sign transactions offline
- Requires technical knowledge
- Useful for automated processes and scripts

## Mobile vs. Browser Extension Wallets

Understanding the differences between mobile and browser extension wallets can help you choose the right option for your needs.

### Mobile Wallets

Mobile wallets are fully packaged apps that allow all featured actions through the mobile interface:

- Convenient for on-the-go access
- Self-contained with all necessary functionality
- Some support hardware wallets through Bluetooth
- Generally can't connect to third-party web apps
- Examples: Nova Wallet, Fearless Wallet, Polkawallet, SubWallet (mobile version)

### Browser Extension Wallets

Browser extensions integrate with your web browser:

- Connect to web-based dApps and services
- Usually more limited in standalone functionality
- Excellent for interacting with the broader ecosystem
- Examples: Talisman, SubWallet (extension version), Polkadot extension, PolkaGate
