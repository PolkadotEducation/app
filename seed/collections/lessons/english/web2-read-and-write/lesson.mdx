After the early phase of the internet known as Web1, which was characterized by static websites and limited interaction, a new era emerged—Web2. Often referred to as the “Social Web,” Web2 transformed the internet into a dynamic, participatory environment where users not only read content but also contributed to it. This shift democratized online communication, introduced social networking, and created entirely new digital economies based on engagement and data.

## Historical Context

Web2 began to take shape in the early 2000s, fueled by advancements in web technologies and a growing user base eager to interact more meaningfully online. Platforms like Blogger and Wikipedia enabled users to create and share content without needing technical expertise. Soon after, social media platforms such as Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005), and Twitter (2006) brought global audiences into real-time conversation.

This period also saw the rise of cloud computing, smartphones, and broadband internet—all of which enabled faster, richer, and more interactive user experiences. The focus of the web shifted from documents to applications, and from institutions to individuals.

## Key Characteristics of Web2

### User-Generated Content

One of the most defining features of Web2 is the dominance of content created by users. Whether through blogs, videos, tweets, or product reviews, everyday individuals became the primary publishers of the internet. This transformation gave rise to platforms where users contribute content in exchange for visibility, followers, and in some cases, monetization.

### Social Networking and Interactivity

Web2 enabled real-time social interaction. Social networks allowed users to build personal profiles, connect with others, and engage through comments, likes, and shares. This interaction formed digital communities and echo chambers, changing how people socialize, consume news, and form opinions.

### Rich User Experiences and Dynamic Interfaces

Technologies like AJAX, JavaScript, and modern front-end frameworks introduced interactivity to the web. Sites became faster and more application-like, offering drag-and-drop functionality, real-time collaboration, and responsive design. Apps like Gmail, Facebook, and Google Maps set new standards for usability and performance.

### Platformization and APIs

Large tech companies evolved into platforms that hosted third-party applications and services through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). This led to a highly interconnected digital ecosystem where users could log into multiple apps using one identity and developers could build on top of existing services, creating synergies and dependencies.

### Data Centralization and Surveillance

With the convenience of centralized platforms came a trade-off: user data. Companies like Google, Meta (Facebook), and Amazon began harvesting massive amounts of personal information to fuel targeted advertising models. While this enabled “free” services, it also led to major concerns about privacy, data security, algorithmic bias, and the monopolization of digital infrastructure.

## Challenges of Web2

Web2’s success brought critical issues to light:

- **Monetization of attention**: Algorithms prioritized engagement, often favoring sensational or divisive content.
- **Censorship and control**: Centralized platforms could moderate or remove content unilaterally.
- **Data privacy violations**: Scandals like Cambridge Analytica exposed how personal data could be misused.
- **Platform dependency**: Creators and businesses became reliant on platforms with opaque policies and shifting rules.

These challenges revealed the limits of Web2’s architecture and laid the groundwork for the emergence of a new paradigm: Web3.

## Summary

This lesson explored the evolution of the internet during the Web2 era—marked by the rise of user-generated content, dynamic applications, and centralized platforms. We examined how social media, APIs, and cloud-based technologies enabled interactivity and scalability, while also introducing problems related to data control and privacy. Web2 made the internet more accessible and participatory, but its limitations prompted a reimagining of how the internet should be owned, governed, and experienced—setting the stage for Web3.
