Polkadot's development and growth are primarily driven by two key organizations: Web3 Foundation and Parity Technologies. Understanding these organizations is crucial to comprehending Polkadot's vision, development approach, and governance structure.

## Web3 Foundation: The Vision Keeper

Web3 Foundation is a Swiss Stiftung (foundation) established under Swiss law. Founded by Dr. Gavin Wood, Web3 Foundation's primary focus is the development, deployment, and maintenance of "Web3" â€“ the decentralized web.

### Mission and Purpose

Web3 Foundation's purpose is to nurture and steward cutting-edge technologies and applications at all levels of the Web3 technology stack. Its principal focus includes:

- Research, development, and deployment of Web3 technologies
- Funding and maintenance of Web3 technologies
- Advocacy and education
- Developer adoption
- Support of middleware and base-layer applications

The foundation seeks to fund or otherwise assist in the development of projects aligned with its mission, including:

- Innovative blockchain technologies
- Cryptographic messaging protocols
- Peer-to-peer networking infrastructure
- Crypto-economic mechanisms
- Data publication systems

### Governance Structure

The Web3 Foundation Council is the foundation's governing body, responsible for its management. The council includes Dr. Gavin Wood (President and Founder), Dr. Aeron Buchanan (Vice President), and Reto Trinkler.

As a Swiss foundation, Web3 Foundation is subject to mandatory supervision by federal or cantonal authorities. Its application for approval by the Federal Foundation Supervisory Authority was approved in July 2018.

### Relationship with Polkadot

Polkadot is the flagship protocol of Web3 Foundation. While the foundation doesn't directly build software, it contracts with third-party builders to develop the technology. The most prominent of these relationships is with Parity Technologies, which was commissioned to build the initial implementation of Polkadot.

Web3 Foundation has used a substantial amount of the proceeds from the sale of DOT to finance the development of Web3 technologies, including Polkadot. It's important to note that there is no group relationship between Web3 Foundation and Parity Technologies, with robust measures in place to ensure probity in decision-making.

### Grants Program

One of Web3 Foundation's most significant contributions to the ecosystem is its grants program. In 2023 alone, the foundation received 324 applications and signed 135 grants across 54 countries. By the end of 2023, the foundation had reached a milestone of signing its 600th grant since the program began in 2017.

The grants program has been instrumental in fostering a diverse ecosystem of developers and projects building on Polkadot, contributing to the network's growth and adoption.

## Parity Technologies: The Technical Architect

Parity Technologies is the primary technical contributor to Polkadot, having been contracted by Web3 Foundation to build the first implementation of the Polkadot protocol.

### Founding and Leadership

Founded by Ethereum co-founder Dr. Gavin Wood and former Ethereum Foundation Head of Security Dr. Jutta Steiner, Parity is a global team of distributed systems engineers, cryptographers, solutions architects, and researchers.

The company's leadership has evolved over time, with current key figures including Chrissy Hill, who serves as Chief Legal Officer and interim COO.

### Technical Contributions

Parity has fundamentally shaped the blockchain industry through several significant contributions:

1. **Parity Ethereum Client**: Before focusing on Polkadot, Parity developed one of the most widely-adopted Ethereum clients.
2. **Implementations of Other Blockchains**: The team has also built implementations of Bitcoin and Zcash.
3. **Substrate Framework**: Parity developed Substrate, the blockchain development framework that powers Polkadot and enables developers to create custom blockchains.
4. **Polkadot Implementation**: Parity built the first implementation of Polkadot in Rust, known as Parity Polkadot.

### Commitment to Multiple Implementations

While Parity built the first implementation of Polkadot in Rust, the vision for Polkadot includes multiple implementations in different programming languages. This approach enhances decentralization by ensuring that no single implementation can dominate the network.

It is critically important to have multiple implementations of the Polkadot protocol for a number of reasons, including decentralization, knowledge dispersion, and better definitions of the protocol. Multiple implementations improve network resilience and add to the decentralization of the network.

## Recent Developments and Decentralization Efforts

In recent years, both Web3 Foundation and Parity Technologies have taken significant steps to further decentralize the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Parity's Structural Changes

In late 2023, Parity underwent substantial structural changes, reducing its headcount primarily in areas involved with ecosystem activity support rather than core technology development. This restructuring was part of a broader effort to decentralize the ecosystem and empower the community to take more ownership.

### Decentralized Futures Fund

Following Parity's restructuring, Web3 Foundation announced the launch of the $55 million Decentralized Futures fund. The stated purpose of this fund is to aid the ecosystem in its efforts to further decentralize itself and arrive at a sustainable position where activity contributes to the utility and demand of Polkadot's main resource, Coretime.

### Community Empowerment

The full decentralization of Polkadot through OpenGov has given a voice to diverse community members and ensures that Polkadot's journey is powered by collective wisdom.

It is a commitment to achieving empowerment of many different voices, diverse voices within a community. While it's a natural tendency to centralize, it's much more powerful, inclusive, and ultimately successful for the longevity of the technology to decentralize.

## Conclusion

Web3 Foundation and Parity Technologies have been instrumental in bringing Polkadot from concept to reality. Web3 Foundation provides the vision, funding, and governance framework, while Parity Technologies delivers the technical expertise and implementation.

Both organizations are committed to the principles of decentralization, working to create a network that is not dependent on any single entity for its continued development and operation. Their efforts have resulted in Polkadot becoming one of the most decentralized networks in the blockchain space, with a Nakamoto coefficient that increased from 93 to 132 in 2024, making it the first major network to achieve a rating over 100.

As Polkadot continues to evolve, both Web3 Foundation and Parity Technologies are gradually stepping back from centralized control, empowering the community to take ownership of the network's future through its advanced on-chain governance system.

## Summary

In this class, we explored the two key organizations behind Polkadot: Web3 Foundation and Parity Technologies. Web3 Foundation, founded by Dr. Gavin Wood, provides the vision, funding, and governance framework for Polkadot and other Web3 technologies. Parity Technologies, also co-founded by Dr. Wood, is the primary technical contributor, having built the first implementation of Polkadot and the Substrate framework. Both organizations are committed to decentralization, as evidenced by recent structural changes and the launch of the Decentralized Futures fund. Their collaborative efforts have resulted in Polkadot becoming one of the most decentralized and technically advanced blockchain networks in the industry.
