The first generation of the World Wide Web, known as **Web1** or the **Read-Only Web**, represents the early phase of the internet's public use, spanning roughly from the **early 1990s to the early 2000s**. It was a time when websites were static, content was centralized, and users were primarily **consumers of information**. Understanding Web1 is essential to appreciate how the internet evolved from **a collection of documents** into **an interactive and social environment**.

## Key Characteristics of Web1

### 1. Static Web Pages

- Web1 consisted of **HTML-only** websites with **no interactivity**.
- Content was manually coded by developers and published online.
- No databases or dynamic content rendering.

### 2. Centralized Content Creation

- Only a small group of individuals or organizations (e.g., universities, governments, companies) had the skills and infrastructure to create websites.
- The average user **could not publish or interact** with content.

### 3. Read-Only Experience

- Users visited websites **just to read or view** information.
- There was **no commenting, sharing, liking, or posting**.
- Navigation was linear: hyperlink to hyperlink.

### 4. Browsers as Primary Interface

- Access to the web was through early browsers like:
  - **Mosaic (1993)**
  - **Netscape Navigator (1994)**
  - **Internet Explorer (1995)**

## Common Use Cases of Web1

| Use Case              | Description                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Personal Homepages    | Early adopters creating static pages about themselves or hobbies |
| Corporate Sites       | Businesses publishing company information                        |
| Academic Repositories | Universities and labs posting research or course materials       |
| News Portals          | Digitized versions of newspapers or journals                     |
| Online Directories    | Yahoo! and DMOZ offered categorized lists of sites               |

## Limitations of Web1

- **No user-generated content**
- **No real-time interaction**
- **Limited scalability for large audiences**
- **Poor accessibility and user experience**
- **No personalization or recommendation algorithms**

Web1 was essentially **a digital library**—rich in information but lacking the tools for engagement, collaboration, or customization.

## Fun Facts

- The first **web page** is still live at: [http://info.cern.ch](http://info.cern.ch)
- Tim Berners-Lee’s original browser was also an **editor**, but this feature was removed in early web browsers.
- Early web search was done through **human-curated directories**, not algorithms.
- In 1999, only **4% of the world’s population** had internet access.

## Web1 Legacy and Transition

Web1 laid the foundation for everything that came after:

- It **standardized protocols** (HTTP, HTML, URL)
- Made **information accessible** globally
- Sparked a **global movement** toward digital literacy and web presence

However, its limitations led to the rise of a new phase: **Web2**, where users became contributors, communities were formed, and data became the new oil.

## Conclusion

Web1 was a revolutionary first step in building a **global, interconnected information space**. Though limited in interactivity, it democratized access to information and inspired the digital age. It showed the world the power of open standards and paved the way for the **participatory web** that followed.

## Summary

This class explored **Web1**, the **Read-Only phase** of the internet, which emerged during the 1990s.

We covered:

- Its **static, centralized** structure
- The **user experience** as passive consumers
- Early browsers and popular use cases
- The **limitations** that shaped the push toward interactivity
- How Web1 created the **technical and cultural groundwork** for future phases

Web1 was the beginning of the web as we know it—simple, open, and ready to evolve.
