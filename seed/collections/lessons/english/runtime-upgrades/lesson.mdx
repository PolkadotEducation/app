Runtime upgrades are one of the most groundbreaking features of the Polkadot ecosystem, enabling blockchains to evolve and adapt without requiring hard forks. This “forkless upgrade” capability sets Polkadot and Substrate-based blockchains apart from traditional blockchain networks.

## Historical Context

Historically, upgrading a blockchain was a complex and risky process. Much like early video games distributed on cartridges with prewritten code, traditional blockchains required hard forks to implement meaningful changes. These forks often took months of coordination and, when controversial, could divide entire communities.

## What Are Runtime Upgrades?

Runtime upgrades are updates to the code that defines a blockchain’s state logic and transition rules. In Substrate and Polkadot, the runtime is stored on-chain as a WebAssembly (Wasm) blob, allowing it to be updated through on-chain transactions with no need for external coordination between node operators.

## How Runtime Upgrades Work

Polkadot’s runtime upgrade mechanism is driven by its on-chain governance system:

- **Proposal**: Any DOT holder can propose a runtime upgrade via Polkadot’s OpenGov system.
- **Voting**: The community votes on the proposal through transparent referenda.
- **Automatic Execution**: If approved, the upgrade is automatically deployed in subsequent blocks without manual validator coordination.
- **Continuous Operation**: Validators continue operating as usual, updating their clients only when the software changes—not when the runtime changes.

This stands in contrast to traditional blockchains, where all node operators must manually coordinate updates.

## Benefits of Runtime Upgrades

- **Continuous Evolution**: Blockchains can keep up with technology by implementing new features and fixes rapidly.
- **Risk Reduction**: Avoids the risk of chain splits caused by contentious hard forks, keeping communities unified.
- **Transparent Governance**: Upgrades are managed through inclusive on-chain governance where all token holders can participate.
- **Uninterrupted Operation**: The network remains fully functional during the upgrade process, with no downtime.
- **Developer Flexibility**: Developers can deploy updates quickly, without lengthy hard fork coordination.

## Technical Components

Technically, Substrate and Polkadot runtime upgrades involve several elements:

- **WebAssembly (Wasm)**: The runtime is compiled to Wasm, a binary format optimized for performance, originally designed for web browsers but adapted for blockchains.
- **Runtime Versioning**: Each runtime version includes `runtime_version` and `transaction_version`. The `transaction_version` is crucial for correct encoding and decoding of extrinsics.
- **Polkadot Host**: The native component that executes the Wasm runtime and provides required host functions.

## Validator Upgrade Process

For validators and node operators, runtime upgrades are straightforward:

- Validators do **not** need to update their software when a runtime upgrade occurs, since the Wasm blob is stored and executed on-chain.
- They only need to update their client software when changes are made to the client itself—not the runtime.
- When necessary, client updates are communicated via official channels with documented upgrade procedures.

## Runtime Upgrades in Parachains

Parachains in the Polkadot ecosystem benefit from independent runtime upgrades:

- Parachain runtimes can be upgraded automatically without needing coordination with Relay Chain validators.
- Each parachain can manage its own upgrade process via internal governance, while still benefiting from shared Polkadot security.

## Substrate and Runtime Upgrades

Substrate inherits this forkless upgrade capability, making it available to all Substrate-based blockchains:

- Substrate’s governance tools allow developers to implement new features without splitting the network.
- This safe and efficient upgrade mechanism enables Substrate chains to adapt to innovation and changing market needs.

## Conclusion

Runtime upgrades represent a core innovation in blockchain design, allowing networks like Polkadot and Substrate-based chains to evolve securely and efficiently without the risks and disruption of hard forks. This capability not only streamlines technical improvements but also strengthens community governance by allowing token holders to directly shape the future of their networks. As blockchain ecosystems mature, forkless upgrades become an increasingly valuable advantage, allowing projects to remain agile and user-focused.
