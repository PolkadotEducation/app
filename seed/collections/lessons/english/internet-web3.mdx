### What is the Internet?

The internet is a global network that connects millions of computers around the world, allowing people to communicate, share information, and access a vast amount of data from virtually anywhere. It operates like a system of digital roads, where each device (like a computer or smartphone) can send and receive information from other connected devices.

The internet has revolutionized the way the world communicates, shares information, and conducts business. To understand the depth of this revolution, it is essential to explore the three main phases of the internet: Web1, Web2, and Web3.

### WEB1 - The Era of Static Information?

In its early days, the internet was an unexplored territory, a new digital world that emerged in the 1990s. This initial phase, known as Web1 or Web 1.0, was marked by simplicity. Web pages were essentially repositories of information, composed of static text and images.

Websites functioned as digital libraries, where users could access and read content, but interaction was minimal. It was a one-way internet, where businesses and organizations provided information, and users simply consumed it.

This era was crucial for establishing the foundations of global communication, but the limitations were evident. Web1 was a one-way street, efficient for disseminating information but insufficient for creating an interactive and dynamic experience.

### WEB2 - The Era of Collaboration and Participation?

With the dawn of the 21st century, the internet underwent a significant transformation. Web2, or Web 2.0, emerged, bringing with it the era of interactivity and collaboration. In this new phase, the internet shifted from being merely a repository of information to becoming a platform where users could not only consume but also create and share content.

Web2 was driven by social networks, blogs, wikis, and other interactive platforms that allowed people to express their ideas, share their lives, and collaborate in real-time. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon became the pillars of this new internet, controlling vast amounts of data and playing central roles in users' online experiences.

However, with this interactivity came a new challenge: the centralization of power. Large corporations began to dominate the internet, controlling access to information and holding power over users' personal data. This centralization raised concerns about privacy, security, and information monopolies.

### WEB3 - The Era of Autonomy and Decentralization?

In response to the limitations of Web2, a new phase of the internet is emerging: Web3 or Web 3.0. This phase is still under development, but its central premise is decentralization. Web3 aims to return control to users, allowing them to be the true owners of their data and content.

Through technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies, Web3 promises to create an internet where interactions are secure, transparent, and free of intermediaries. Instead of relying on large corporations to manage information, Web3 enables users to interact directly with one another on decentralized networks, ensuring greater autonomy and privacy.

Web3 represents a vision of a fairer and more equitable internet, where power is distributed and barriers to centralized control are dismantled. It is an evolution that seeks to correct the flaws of previous phases, building a global network that respects individual freedom and promotes innovation.

### Conclusion

Web3 is like a new road, even more open and free, where travelers have more power over their journeys. There is no longer a need for large companies to control traffic; now, each traveler can build and control their own destination.

Itâ€™s like having the keys to the road in your own hands, where everyone can decide how they want to travel and share their experiences.

**This is the journey of the internet:** a road that started simple, grew in complexity, and is now evolving to empower each of its travelers. And this journey continues, with all of us being a part of it.
