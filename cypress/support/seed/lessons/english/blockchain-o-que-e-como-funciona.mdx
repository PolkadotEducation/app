## What is it and how does it work?

Modern companies have adopted corporate blockchain to ensure more transparency and security in their operations. They seek a simple and clear definition of this innovative "distributed ledger" technology to better understand how it works and its importance.

### What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a technology that allows the immutable and real-time recording of transactions and properties. In simple terms, it is a reliable and secure recording system, difficult to tamper with, that tracks and identifies asset ownership.

### How Does Blockchain Work?

Imagine blockchain as a database divided into blocks of information. These blocks are copied and replicated across multiple computers on the network, all synchronized with each other.

When a new transaction is added or modified, all the blocks on the network are updated simultaneously, ensuring that everyone has an identical and updated copy.

Each block of information is protected by encryption, making it practically inviolable, similar to the security of online banking portals. Blockchain can store various types of records, such as contracts, deeds, logistical manifests, among others, enabling the secure sharing of information in real-time.

### Why is Blockchain Important?

Blockchain is essential for increasing transaction security. Each new block of information is added to the end of the chain, with a unique digital signature (or "hash"), which is like a secret mathematical code.

Changing any information in an already registered block would require modifying all subsequent blocks on the network, which is almost impossible. This makes blockchain highly resistant to hacker attacks.

Furthermore, blockchain eliminates intermediaries in transactions, such as lawyers and banks, making processes more direct and cost-effective. Transactions are validated and executed securely and transparently, which can reduce costs and increase efficiency.

### Blockchain Benefits

- **Transparency:** All information on the blockchain is visible to all participants in the network and cannot be altered, reducing fraud and increasing trust.
- **Security:** The distributed and encrypted nature of blockchain makes it difficult for hackers to act, showing promise for cybersecurity and the Internet of Things (IoT).
- **Fewer Intermediaries:** Blockchain facilitates direct transactions between parties, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing associated costs.
- **Traceability:** Since records are immutable, blockchain is ideal for tracking the origin of products in complex supply chains.
- **Efficiency and ROI:** Automating processes and eliminating intermediaries accelerate return on investment (ROI) and increase operational efficiency.
- **Automation:** With smart contracts, blockchain can automate agreement execution when specific conditions are met, reducing time and manual effort.
- **Data Privacy:** While information is publicly verified, data is protected by encryption, ensuring privacy.

### Types of Blockchain Networks

There are four main types of blockchain networks:

1. **Public:** Open access for everyone, like in the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum.
2. **Semi-private:** Controlled by a single company that grants access to qualified users.
3. **Private:** Fully controlled by an organization, used for specific purposes within the company.
4. **Consortium:** Controlled by a group of organizations, most used in business environments.

### Use Cases

Blockchain is being used in various sectors, from supply chains to the public sector and financial services.

For example:

- **Supply Chain:** Tracks and verifies product authenticity, from the origin to the end consumer.
- **Public Sector:** Used for official asset records, such as real estate and vehicles, as well as facilitating electoral processes and improving government transparency.
- **Utilities:** Applied in solar energy sales between neighbors and energy trading between large companies.
- **Human Resources:** Quickly and securely verifies and validates candidates' qualifications and employment histories.
- **Finance:** Simplifies accounting processes and financial transactions, ensuring more security and efficiency.

### Conclusion

Blockchain is like a large digital ledger where all transactions are recorded securely and transparently. Each record is protected by encryption and distributed across multiple computers, making it very difficult for anyone to alter the information.

This brings more security and trust to company operations, eliminating the need for intermediaries and allowing processes to be faster and more cost-effective.

Blockchain is being used in various areas, from tracking products to ensuring the authenticity of documents and facilitating financial transactions. It is a technology that is changing the way businesses and governments operate, making everything more efficient and secure.
