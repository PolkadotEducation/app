## What is it and how does it work?

Modern companies have been adopting the corporative blockchain to ensure greater transparency and safety in their operations. They look for a simple and clear definition of this innovative "distributed record" technology to better understand its operation and importance.

### What is Blockchain?

The Blockchain is a technology that allows for immutable, real-time recording of transactions and properties. In simple terms, it's a trustworthy, safe and hard-to-violate record system that traces and identifies assets' property.

### How does the Blockchain work?

Imagine the blockchain as a database divided in information blocks. Those blocks are then copied and replicated in many computers in the network, all synced among themselves.

When a new transaction is added or modified, all blocks in the network are updated simultaneously, making sure they all have an identical and updated copy.

Each information block is protected by encryption, making it practically inviolable, similar to the safety of online banking portals. The Blockchain can store different kinds of records, like contracts, writings, logistical manifests, and the like, allowing for safe and real-time sharing of information.

### Why is the Blockchain important?

The Blockchain is essential to increase transaction safety. Each new information block is added to the end of the chain, with an unique digital signature (or "hash") which is like a secret mathematical code.

Changing any information in an already registered block would require the modification of all subsequent blocks in the network, which is almost impossible. This makes the Blockchain extremely resistant to hacker attacks.

In addition, the Blockchain eliminates the need of intermediaries in transactions, such as lawyers and banks, making the processes more direct and economic. The transactions are validated and executed in a safe and transparent way, which can reduce costs and increase efficiency.

### Benefits of the Blockchain

- **Transparency:** All information in the Blockchain is visible to every member of the network and cannot be changed, which reduces frauds and increases trust.
- **Safety:** The blockchain's distributed and encrypted nature hinders hacker actions, being promising to cybersecurity and to the Internet of Things (IoT).
- **Less Intermediaries:** The blockchain eases direct transaction between parties, eliminating the need of intermediaries and reducing associated costs.
- **Traceability:** As the records are immutable, the Blockchain is ideal for tracing the origin of products in complex supply chains.
- **Efficiency and ROI:** The automation of processes and the elimination of the need of intermediaries speeds up the return over investment (ROI) and increases operational efficiency.
- **Automation:** With smart contracts, the Blockchain can automate the execution of deals when certain conditions are met, reducing time and manual effort.
- **Data Privacy:** Even though information is verified publicly, the data is protected by encryption, ensuring privacy.


### Types of Blockchain Networks

There are four main types of Blockchain networks:

1. **Public:** Open access to everyone, which is the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum.
2. **Semi-private:** Controlled by a single company that allows access to qualified users.
3. **Private:** Controlled totally by an organization and used for specific purposes inside the company.
4. **Consortium:** Controlled by a group of organizations, being the most used type in business environments.

### Use cases

The Blockchain is being used in many sectors, from the supply chain to the public sector and financial services.

For example:

- **Supply chain:** Tracks and verifies product authenticity, from the origin to the final consumer.
- **Public sector:** Used for official asset records, such as property and vehicles, as well as easing electoral processes and improving government transparency.
- **Public Services:** Applied in solar energy sales between neighbors and energy trade between big companies.
- **Human Resources:** Verifies and validates qualifications and job history of candidates in a quick and safe way.
- **Finances:** Simplifies accounting processes and financial transactions, ensuring greater safety and efficiency.

### Conclusion

The Blockchain is like a big digital record book, where all transactions are recorded in a safe and transparent way. Each record is protected by encryption and distributed between many computers, which makes it very hard for someone to alter that information.

This brings more safety and trust to company operations, elminating the need of intermediaries and allowing for the processes to be quicker and more economic.

The Blockchain is being used in many fields, from tracking products to ensuring document authenticity and easing financial transactions. It's a technology that is changing the way how businesses and governments work, making everything more efficient and safe.
