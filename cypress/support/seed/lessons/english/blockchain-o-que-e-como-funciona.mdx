## What is it and how does it work?

Modern companies have been adopting the corporative blockchain to ensure greater transparency and safety in their operations. They look for a simple and clear definition of this innovative "distributed record" technology to better understand its operation and importance.

### What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a technology that allows immutable, real-time recording of transactions and property. In simple terms, it's a trustworthy, safe and hard to be violated record system that tracks and identifies asset property.

### How does the Blockchain work?

Imagine the blockchain as a database divided in information blocks. Those blocks are copied and replicated in many computers in the network, all synced among themselves.

When a new transaction is added or modified, every block in the network is simultaneously updated, ensuring they all have an identical and updated copy.

Each information block is protected by encryption, making it practically inviolable, similar to online banking portal security. The blockchain can store different kinds of records, such as contracts, writings, logistical manifests, and the like, allowing safe, real-time information sharing.

### Why is the Blockchain important?

The Blockchain is essential to increase transaction safety. Each new information block is added to the end of the chain with an unique digital signature (or "hash") which is like a secret math code.

Changing any information in an already registered block would require modifying all subsequent blocks in the network, which is almost impossible. This makes the Blockchain extremely resistant against hacker attacks.

In addition, the blockchain eliminates the need of intermediaries in transactions, such as lawyers and banks, making the processes more direct and economic. The transactions are validated and executed in a safe and transparent way, which can reduce costs and increase efficiency.

### Benefits of the Blockchain

- **Transparency:** All information in the blockchain is visible to all members of the network and cannot be altered, which reduces fraud and increases trust.
- **Safety:** The blockchain's distributed and encrypted nature hinders hacker action, being promising to cybersecurity and the Internet of Things (IoT).
- **Less Intermediaries:** The blockchain eases direct transactions between parties, eliminating the need of intermediaries and reducing associated costs.
- **Traceability:** Since the records are immutable, the blockchain is ideal to trace the origin of products in complex supply chains.
- **Efficiency and ROI:** Process automation and the elimination of the need of intermediaries speeds up return over investment (ROI) and increase operational efficiency.
- **Automation:** With smart contracts, the blockchain can automate deal executions when certain conditions are met, reducing time and manual effort.
- **Data Privacy:** Although information is verified publicly, the data is protected by encryption, ensuring privacy.

### Types of Blockchain Networks:

There are four main types of blockchain networks:

1. **Public:** Open access to everyone, which is the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum.
2. **Semi-private:** Controlled by a single company that allows access to qualified users.
3. **Private:** Controlled totally by an organization, used for specific purposes inside the company.
4. **Consortium:** Controlled by a group of organizations, this type is used the most in business environments.

### Use Cases

The blockchain is being used in different sectors, from the supply chain to the public sector and financial services.

For example:

- **Supply Chain:** Traces and verifies product authenticity, from the origin to the final consumer.
- **Public Sector:** Used for active official records, such as property and vehicles, aside from easing electoral processes and improving government transparency.
- **Public Services:** Applied in solar energy sales between neighbors and energy trade between big companies.
- **Human Resources:** Verifies and validates qualifications and job history of candidates in a quick and safe way.
- **Finances:** Simplifies accounting processes and financial transactions, ensuring greater safety and efficiency.

### Conclusion

The blockchain is like a big digital record book where all transactions are recorded in a safe and transparent way. Each record is protected by encryption and distributed between many computers, which makes it very hard for someone to alter information.

This brings more safety and trust to company operations, eliminating the need of intermediaries and allowing processes to be faster and more economic.

The blockchain is being used in many fields, from tracing products to ensuring document authenticity and easing financial transactions. It's a technology that is changing the way how businesses and governments work, making everything more efficient and safe.
