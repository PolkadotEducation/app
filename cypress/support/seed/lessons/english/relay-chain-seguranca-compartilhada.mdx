## Relay Chain and Shared Security

Polkadot is an innovative technology in the world of blockchains, built to improve the way how different blockchains connect and work together. To understand this, it's useful to think on a blockchain as a kind of digital ledger that records transactions and information in a safe and transparent way.

However, each blockchain traditionally works as an isolated "island" - they cannot communicate directly with one another. That's where Polkadot comes in, acting as a bridge between those "islands".

### Polkadot's Relay Chain

Polkadot's Relay Chain is like the heart of the Polkadot system. It's the main part of the network that keeps everything working in a coordinated and safe way. To illustrate, imagine Polkadot is an airport where each terminal is a "Parachain" (different blockchains with specific purposes). The airport's main building (the Relay Chain) connects all terminals and ensures they can exchange passengers (information) in a safe, organized way.

#### Relay Chain's Main Functions:

1. **Connect and Coordinate:** Allows connected blockchains (parachains) to communicate and exchange information in an efficient way.
2. **Shared Security:** The Relay Chain handles the security of all connected parachains. Instead of each one having its own security system, the Relay Chain offers a shared security system.

### Shared Security

Polkadot's shared security is one of its most important aspects. Imagine you have many houses (representing different blockchains in a neighborhood, and they share a security team that protects all houses at the same time. This is much more efficient and safe than forcing each house to create its own security system.

Upon sharing this security, the Relay Chain allows blockchains connected to Polkadot to take advantage of a robust infrastructure without having to spend time and resources creating individual security.

### Conclusion

Polkadot's Relay Chain is the central element that keeps all of the network connected and operating in an efficient and safe way. Just like an airport connects its terminals, the Relay Chain allows different blockchains (parachains) to communicate and share information in a fluid way.

Aside from its coordination function, the Relay Chain offers shared security, protecting all blockchains connected to the network. Upon sharing a robusst security infrastructure, Polkadot ensures the expansion of its ecossystem increasingly strengthens the network.
